Welcome to PetForDesktop land!  
PetForDesktop allows you to integrate and interact with your pet and customize it whenever you want!  

## How to install?
Just download the [lastest version](https://github.com/Renardjojo/PetDesktop//releases/latest) of this application and extract it.

## What you can do with PetForDesktop:
- Edge detection of screen content: your pet can jump into any element of your screen.
- Basic physic: you can drag and drop your pet with gravity but also make it bounce on your screen.
- Customize settings : to play with the debugging function, configure your own gravity etc...
- Customize animation
- Replace the existing animation with your own horizontal sprite sheet.
- Walk and jump but also edit and create your own animation !
- Modify the code and contribute! (it's open source and under MIT license!)
- Support development: Developing an app takes a lot of time for free and love is not enough to live on.

## What is currently not possible with PetForDesktop:
- Cook and make your own coffee...
- Use multiple monitors (only the first monitor for now)
- Save your pet's progress
- Launch multiple pets (you can but it is not recommended)
- Works on MacOs and Linux...

## What in the future ?
You can easily check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/Renardjojo/PetForDesktop/milestones) but remember that this software is open source.  
That means you can fork it and modify or contribute to it for anyone! The MTI license allows you to do this, so take advantage of it.  

## Disclamer:
The concept of this application is inspired by another application called [Babafriend](https://hempuli.itch.io/baba-friend). This application is close source and does not allow me to customize the code base and features ... Now you can.  
Fox's sprite sheet was shared by [elthen](https://elthen.itch.io/2d-pixel-art-fox-sprites) and modified to suit my needs.  
PetForDesktop also takes small screenshots of your screen to process collision and edge detection. This application will **NEVER** save or send them!
